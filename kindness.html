<p>One thing people today overlook far too much is the simple
   effective act of kindness. In this cold new world overtaken by
    selfishness and greed is a desperate need for those little
    acts of care. Just a helping hand or a quick show of
    compassion can turn another person’s day completely around.</p>

<p>Sometimes even a friendly smile can save a life. People often
  forget others and become very engrossed in their own problems.
  This leads to a negative downward spiral and a chain reaction
  of selfishness. A generation of selfish people is the last thing
   we need today. Imagine if everybody was willing to be kind and
    compassionate to each other. If it was not forced, but a
     habit. This would change the world.</p>

<p>Everyone has experienced difficult times at one time or
  another when things were not going well and needed an act of
  kindness to brighten up their day. If it wasn’t for that one
  person, that one act of kindness, they might not have the life
  they have today. Remember how effective just the smallest act
  of kindness can be. Know that you can do this for others. In
  the long run, you may not be just helping one person but multiple
  people. Kindness is like the spark from a match that creates a
   forest fire. The forest is a forest of anger, selfishness, and
   cruelty. Kindness can burn through all of those things.</p>

<p>It’s very important for people to remember that anger is
  powerful. So is selfishness along with cruelty. However,
  kindness overpowers all. You may think your kindness makes a
  difference for other people only, but it doesn’t. What comes
  around goes around, and your act will be returned. Your most
  important reward is knowing how much you just helped someone
  in need. You feel satisfaction knowing that you might have saved
   someone’s day, week, or even life. What you have really been
   given is the most precious gift you can receive, the gift of
   kindness. Everyone is capable of being kind. Everyone can help.
    The real question is, why don’t we? This should not be a
    question. Kindness should come automatically. It should be
    common rather than a rarity. We can make this happen and do
    something kind today.</p>
    <p>“No matter how small, an act of kindness never goes
       unnoticed.”</p></div></div>
